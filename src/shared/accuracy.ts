/**
 * Live accuracy for one life: of the shots you fired, how many landed.
 *
 * Nothing in the page keeps this -- the figure on Krunker's death screen is
 * built once, when you die -- so it is counted from two things the game does
 * show while you are alive:
 *
 *  - SHOTS come off the ammo counter. It drops by one per shot. It also moves
 *    for reasons that are not shooting, and those are the whole difficulty:
 *    a reload sends it up, and a weapon swap sends it anywhere, including
 *    down by 24 when a full 30-round gun gives way to a 6-round one.
 *  - HITS come off the hit sound. Krunker's own sound manager plays `hit_0`
 *    on the frame the game decides a shot of yours connected, which is the
 *    signal the custom hitmarker settled on after the #hitmarker element
 *    turned out never to be touched in a live match.
 *
 * What is counted is shots that landed, not bullets that did. A shotgun
 * shell plays a hit for every pellet and a headshot plays `hit_0` and
 * `headshot_0` together; counting sounds would put both over 100%. So a hit
 * claims one waiting shot, sounds on the same frame are one hit, and a hit
 * with no shot waiting -- a knife -- claims nothing.
 *
 * Pure, so the arithmetic is testable without being in a match.

/**
 * Escape, taken in the main process while the game holds the mouse.
 *
 * WHY. Pressing Escape to leave a match made clicking back in take about two
 * seconds, however fast you clicked. Chromium says so in as many words:
 * "Pointer lock cannot be acquired immediately after the user has exited the
 * lock." It counts Escape as you leaving the lock and makes the next request
 * wait. A lock the page releases from code carries no such wait, and neither
 * does losing it to Alt-Tab, which is why that clicked straight back in.
 *
 * WHERE IT HAS TO BE TAKEN. The first attempt took the key in
 * `before-input-event` and changed nothing: Chromium's view layer releases the
 * lock on Escape before Electron emits that event, so by the time the key
 * could be refused it had already counted. So while the game holds the mouse
 * and its window is focused, Escape is registered as a global shortcut, which
 * Windows consumes before the window receives a keystroke at all. The lock is
 * then released from main at once, because the keyUp is not consumed and
 * counts as escaping just the same if the lock is still held when it lands:
 * see takeEscape in main/index.ts. Registered only for that long, so no other
 * application ever loses the key.
 *
 * Only while the mouse is locked and nothing is being typed into, which the
 * page reports. Everywhere else Escape reaches the page untouched: it still
 * closes chat, menus, windows and the client's own dialogs.
 *
 * Pure, because the awkward part is the rest of the press. Taking a keyDown
 * and letting its keyUp through would hand the page half a keystroke, and a
 * held Escape repeats: after the first repeat the lock is already gone, so a
 * repeat judged on its own would reach Krunker and act on the menu that just
 * opened. Once a press is taken, the whole press is taken.

 * modifiers held, and starts the same refusal as a plain one. In a match that
 * is most presses -- crouch and slide are held on Shift or Ctrl -- which is
 * why Escape stayed fast on the end screen, where nobody is holding anything,

/**
 * Setting presets: named snapshots of a handful of Krunker's own settings,
 * switched between from the Presets tab.
 *
 * A preset belongs to one scope, sensitivity or field of view, rather than
 * holding everything. A sniper sensitivity and a wide FOV are two separate
 * choices, and a preset that carried both could not change one without
 * dragging the other along. Supporting more of the game's settings means
 * adding a scope below. Nothing else in here needs to change.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: reading and writing the game is handed in, so the
 * part that decides what a switch writes can be tested without a game.
 *
 * WHAT A SNAPSHOT IS. The game stores a setting only once it has been changed.
 * A missing key means "at the default", which is a value like any other, so
 * a snapshot records the default where it finds nothing rather than leaving
 * the setting out. Otherwise switching from a preset with FOV 120 to one taken
 * at the default FOV would leave you on 120.
 *
 * Per-weapon copies (`fov_3`, see KRUNKER_SETTINGS) cannot be listed up front
 * without knowing how many weapons the game has, so they are taken from what
 * is actually in storage. A copy that is in storage now but not in the preset
 * was at its default when the preset was taken, and a switch puts it back
 * there.

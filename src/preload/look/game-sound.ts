/**
 * Krunker's sound manager, as something several features can listen to.
 *
 * `window.SOUND.play(name)` is the game's own audio, and a few of its sounds
 * are the most reliable signals the page gives: `hit_0` plays on the frame
 * the game decides a shot of yours landed. The custom hitmarker found that
 * out after the #hitmarker element turned out never to be touched in a live
 * match, and live accuracy counts hits off the same sounds.
 *
 * One wrap for all of them rather than one each. Each extra wrapper is
 * another function on the path of every sound the game plays, and the retry
 * logic below is the part worth having exactly once.
 *
 * Wrapped, never replaced, and the original is always called: this is on the
 * path that makes the sounds you hear, so anything it swallows or throws is
 * audible. A listener that throws is contained for the same reason. Never
 * unwrapped either -- with no listeners it is one Set iteration per sound --
 * because unwrapping would drop any wrapper added on top of it since, such as
 * the built-in headshot script's.

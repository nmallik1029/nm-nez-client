/**
 * Watch one of Krunker's HUD counters for changes.
 *
 * Shared by kill streak and live accuracy, which both need to know when you
 * die and when a match starts over, and both read it the same way:
 *
 *  - going up is the event,
 *  - going down is a new match,
 *  - the first reading after attaching is only a baseline. Joining a match
 *    already on twelve kills is not twelve kills just now, and nor is Krunker
 *    rebuilding its HUD mid-round.
 *
 * `attach` is safe to call on a timer, and should be. Krunker replaces chunks
 * of its HUD, and an observer left on a detached node goes quiet without ever
 * erroring; re-attaching only does anything when the element has changed.

/**
 * Frame-time statistics for the performance HUD.
 *
 * A plain FPS counter hides the thing that actually matters in a shooter: 300
 * FPS with regular 40ms hitches feels far worse than a steady 200. So this
 * reports percentile lows next to the average.
 *
 * "1% low" is the usual convention, the mean of the worst 1% of frame times in
 * the window expressed as FPS, not the 99th-percentile single frame. Averaging
 * the tail jumps around less than reporting one sample.
 *
 * Fixed ring buffer behind it. This runs on every animation frame, so it can't
 * allocate per frame or the profiler turns into the problem.
